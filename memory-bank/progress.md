# Elite Options System - Progress Tracker

## Current Status: Theme Integration Phase

### ✅ What's Working
- **Core Infrastructure**: Dash application framework operational
- **Design System**: CSS custom properties and color palette established
- **Component Architecture**: Modular Python components for dashboard sections
- **Data Integration**: Real-time market data processing capabilities
- **Layout Management**: Responsive grid system with control panels
- **🎉 MAJOR MILESTONE**: Custom dashboard analysis complete with full design system extracted

### 🔄 In Progress
- **Custom Dashboard Integration**: ✅ Analysis complete - Premium Trading Dashboard design system documented
- **Visual Enhancement**: Ready to implement sophisticated dark theme with extracted color palette
- **Component Styling**: Prepared to apply discovered design patterns to existing components

### 📋 Custom Dashboard Analysis Results
**Premium Trading Dashboard Design System Extracted:**
- **Color Palette**: Deep layered blacks (#0A0A0A → #121212 → #1A1A1A) for visual hierarchy
- **Accent System**: Blue (#4A9EFF), Amber (#FFB84A), Violet (#8B5CF6) for highlights
- **Financial Colors**: Emerald (#10B981) gains, Refined red (#EF4444) losses
- **Typography**: Inter font with premium spacing, JetBrains Mono for financial data
- **Component Classes**: panel-base, interactive-base, grid-dashboard, grid-cards
- **Animation System**: Luxury cubic-bezier easing with staggered fade-ins
- **Layout Architecture**: 280px sidebar + responsive grid system

### ⏳ Next Steps
1. **CSS Variables Update**: Implement extracted color palette in elite_design_system.css
2. **Component Classes**: Add panel-base, interactive-base, and layout classes
3. **Component Enhancement**: Apply new styling to existing Dash components
4. **Plotly Theming**: Create chart templates matching the premium design
5. **Animation Integration**: Add smooth transitions and hover effects
6. **Testing & Refinement**: Ensure visual consistency across all components

## [2025-06-16] Time Decay Mode Display Build-Out (v2.5)

**Status:** Complete, pending validation/QA

### Tasks Completed:
- Standardized chart IDs and config for Time Decay Mode (`tdpi_displays`, `vci_strike_charts`)
- Implemented D-TDPI, E-CTR, E-TDFI by strike chart (multi-metric, color-coded, robust)
- Implemented VCI, GCI, DCI gauges for 0DTE (with about/help text)
- Added contextual panels: Ticker Context, Expiration Calendar, Session Clock, Behavioral Patterns
- Added mini heatmap for pin risk/net value flow by strike
- Overlaid pin zones/key levels on main chart (using canonical schema)
- All components robust to missing/partial data
- Modular, extensible code structure for future expansion

**Next:**
- Validation and QA (schema/config alignment, data flow, UI/UX)
- Add/expand automated tests for new components
- Update user-facing documentation if needed
