# Elite Options System v2.5 - Project Brief
## ðŸ§  KNOWLEDGE GRAPH FOUNDATION #1

**FOUNDATIONAL INTELLIGENCE**: The Persistent Knowledge Graph MCP serves as the central intelligence hub and primary authority for all project decisions, patterns, and system evolution.

## Project Name
Elite Options System v2.5

## Purpose
A robust, modular analytics and dashboard system for options market data, focused on SPX and similar underlyings. This system provides comprehensive options trading intelligence through advanced data processing, analytics, and visualization, all coordinated through the Persistent Knowledge Graph MCP as the central intelligence authority.

## Core Goals - Knowledge Graph Coordinated
- **Knowledge Graph Authority**: All system intelligence flows through Persistent Knowledge Graph MCP
- Ingest, process, and analyze options chain and underlying data from multiple sources *(Knowledge Graph: Data Intelligence)*
- Provide advanced metrics (greeks, flows, exposures, regime detection, etc.) *(Knowledge Graph: Analytics Patterns)*
- Deliver actionable analytics and trade recommendations *(Knowledge Graph: Decision Intelligence)*
- Expose results via an interactive dashboard (Dash/Plotly) *(Knowledge Graph: UI Intelligence)*
- Ensure data validation and contract-driven development using Pydantic *(Knowledge Graph: Quality Assurance)*
- Integrate with comprehensive MCP tool suite for enhanced capabilities *(Knowledge Graph: System Orchestration)*

## Scope - Knowledge Graph Authority
- **Knowledge Graph Intelligence**: Central authority for all system decisions and coordination
- **Data Layer**: Multi-source fetching (ConvexValue, Tradier, Yahoo fallback) *(Knowledge Graph: Data Patterns)*
- **Analytics Engine**: Advanced processing and metrics calculation *(Knowledge Graph: Algorithm Intelligence)*
- **Intelligence Layer**: Regime and key level identification *(Knowledge Graph: Market Intelligence)*
- **Signal Generation**: Trade directive and recommendation systems *(Knowledge Graph: Decision Logic)*
- **Dashboard UI**: Interactive visualization with multiple analysis modes *(Knowledge Graph: Interface Intelligence)*
- **System Architecture**: Extensibility and maintainability focus *(Knowledge Graph: Architecture Authority)*
- **MCP Integration**: Leverage 10+ MCP servers for enhanced functionality *(Knowledge Graph: Ecosystem Coordination)*

## Out of Scope
- Direct brokerage integration for live trading
- Real-money trading execution
- Non-SPX underlyings (initial phase)
- Real-time streaming data (batch processing focus)

## Success Criteria - Knowledge Graph Validated
- **Knowledge Graph Authority**: Persistent Knowledge Graph MCP operational as central intelligence hub
- End-to-end data pipeline operational *(Knowledge Graph: Pipeline Intelligence)*
- Dashboard provides actionable insights *(Knowledge Graph: Insight Validation)*
- System handles market data reliably *(Knowledge Graph: Reliability Patterns)*
- Modular architecture supports future expansion *(Knowledge Graph: Evolution Intelligence)*
- Integration with MCP ecosystem enhances capabilities *(Knowledge Graph: Ecosystem Authority)*

## Key Stakeholders
- Options traders and analysts
- Quantitative researchers
- System developers and maintainers

## Timeline
- **Current Phase**: Core system operational
- **Next Phase**: Advanced analytics and UI enhancement
- **Future**: Multi-underlying support and real-time capabilities
