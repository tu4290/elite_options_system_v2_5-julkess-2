2. **Follow Sequential Flow:** Use `get_next_task` → `mark_task_done` → `approve_task_completion`
3. **Monitor Progress:** Utilize `list_requests` and `open_task_details` for oversight
4. **Handle Errors:** Check response status and handle "Request not found" scenarios
5. **Complete Workflows:** Use `approve_request_completion` to finalize requests

### Best Practices

- Always validate request IDs before calling dependent functions
- Use descriptive task titles and detailed descriptions for clarity
- Set appropriate priority levels (high, medium, low) for task organization
- Include comprehensive completion notes when marking tasks done
- Regularly check request status and progress using monitoring tools
