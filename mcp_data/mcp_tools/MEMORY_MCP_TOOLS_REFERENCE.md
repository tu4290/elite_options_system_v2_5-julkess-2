{
  "observations": [{
    "entityName": "Trading Session 2024-01-15",
    "contents": ["SPY showing bullish momentum", "High options volume detected"]
  }]
}

2. Create analysis insights:
{
  "entities": [{
    "name": "SPY Momentum Analysis",
    "entityType": "insight",
    "observations": ["Strong upward momentum confirmed", "Options flow supports bullish thesis"]
  }]

    "observations": ["Session completed successfully", "Key insights preserved"]
  }]
}
```

## Best Practices

### Memory Management
1. **Session Lifecycle**: Create session entities at the start of each interaction
2. **Context Preservation**: Maintain user preferences and settings across sessions
3. **Temporary Data**: Use appropriate entity types for temporary vs. persistent data
4. **Regular Cleanup**: Periodically clean up outdated session data

### Data Organization
1. **Hierarchical Structure**: Organize entities in logical hierarchies
2. **Clear Naming**: Use descriptive, timestamp-based names for sessions
3. **Consistent Types**: Use standardized entity and relation types
4. **Relationship Mapping**: Maintain clear relationships between related entities

### Performance Optimization
1. **Targeted Searches**: Use specific queries to find relevant information quickly
2. **Batch Operations**: Group related operations for efficiency
3. **Selective Updates**: Update only changed information
4. **Memory Limits**: Monitor and manage memory usage for large sessions

### Validated MCP Calling Patterns

**Effective Tool Sequence:**
1. Start with `read_graph` to understand current state
2. Use `create_entities` for new session context
3. Build relationships with `create_relations`
4. Update context dynamically with `add_observations`
5. Clean up with targeted `delete_*` operations

**Search Optimization:**
- Use exact entity name portions for reliable results
- Avoid overly generic search terms
- Combine with `open_nodes` for complete context retrieval

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue: Search returns empty results**
- **Cause**: Search terms too generic or no exact matches
- **Solution**: Use specific terms that appear in entity names or observations
- **Example**: Use "Memory MCP Test" instead of "MCP validation testing"

**Issue: Tool not found errors**
- **Status**: `update_entities` and `update_relations` may not be implemented
- **Workaround**: Use `delete_entities` + `create_entities` for updates
- **Alternative**: Use `add_observations` for content updates

**Issue: Relations not appearing in search**
- **Cause**: Search focuses on entity content, not relation metadata
- **Solution**: Use `open_nodes` or `read_graph` for complete relationship context

### Performance Considerations
- All tested operations complete in < 1 second
- Memory persistence is excellent across operations
- No observed memory leaks or performance degradation
- Safe for production use with proper cleanup practices

### Integration with Other MCPs
1. **Knowledge Graph Sync**: Promote important session insights to Persistent Knowledge Graph
2. **Task Context**: Provide session context to TaskManager for workflow continuity
3. **Analysis Support**: Supply context to Sequential Thinking for better analysis
4. **Search Enhancement**: Use session context to improve search relevance
