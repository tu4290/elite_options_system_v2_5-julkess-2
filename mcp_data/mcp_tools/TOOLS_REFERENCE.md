## Workflow Examples

### Basic Workflow
1. **Create Request:** Use `request_planning` to create a new request with tasks
2. **Get Next Task:** Use `get_next_task` to retrieve the next pending task
3. **Complete Task:** Perform the actual work
4. **Mark Done:** Use `mark_task_done` to mark the task as completed
5. **Approve Task:** Use `approve_task_completion` to approve the completion
6. **Repeat:** Continue with steps 2-5 for remaining tasks
7. **Finalize:** Use `approve_request_completion` to finalize the entire request

### Management Workflow
- **Monitor Progress:** Use `list_requests` to see all requests and their status
- **Inspect Details:** Use `open_task_details` to examine specific tasks
- **Extend Work:** Use `add_tasks_to_request` to add more tasks
- **Modify Tasks:** Use `update_task` to change task details
- **Remove Tasks:** Use `delete_task` to remove unnecessary tasks

## Task Priority Levels
- **high:** Critical tasks that should be completed first
- **medium:** Important tasks with moderate urgency
- **low:** Tasks that can be completed when time permits

## Task Status Values
- **pending:** Task is waiting to be started
- **in_progress:** Task is currently being worked on
- **done:** Task has been completed
- **approved:** Task completion has been approved

## Best Practices

1. **Clear Task Descriptions:** Always provide detailed descriptions for tasks
2. **Appropriate Priorities:** Use priority levels to guide task execution order
3. **Regular Monitoring:** Use `list_requests` to track overall progress
4. **Proper Approval Flow:** Follow the mark_done â†’ approve_completion workflow
5. **Task Dependencies:** Consider task dependencies when planning execution order
